By default, the logger will write a log at /home/ubunutu/prattle.log, and will log every message at level "INFO" and above.
If you wish to be able to reconfigure the logging at run time (including editing the log file location and editing the logging level), you will need to do two things: 
1. Place a valid log4j2 configuration file on your system.  One option is to copy the file in Prattle/src/main/resources/log4j2.xml file to, i.e: /home/ubuntu/log4j2.xml
1. When launching the prattle server, launch with the option -Dlog4j.configurationFile=/path/to/your/config/file (substituting in your config file path), i.e: launch the prattle server with the command
`java -jar -Dlog4j.configurationFile=/home/ubuntu/log4j2.xml Prattle-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`
Configured in this way, any edits you make to the configuration file will take effect shortly after saving the changes.  To change logging level in the provided configuration file, alter <Root level="info"> from "info" to your desired level.
